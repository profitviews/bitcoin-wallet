    "What happened then is worth recalling carefully.  If the news in those days had been about a federally licensed and protected US domiciled bank collapsing (like SVB did months later), we would have been _less_ shocked.  If we'd have been on our guard _appropriately_ - given the unlicensed and off-shore nature of FTX, the warning signs would have been enough to get our money out well in time.  Even SBF's outrageous \"it's a box\" interview with Matt Levine should've been enough for us to keep our funds off-exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we were in good company with our myopia.  Our losses were dwarfed by others who were _themselves_ federally regulated and US domiciled.  Replete as they were with financially licensed risk-managers with top business school educations, they were as flumoxed as we were.  I was ashamed - but double shame on them.  How did it happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Call it SBF's reality distortion field. I have a strong personal grudge with him as the result of that.  I'll be watching his sentencing closely.  But it's happened.  The truth is that the mantra of \"not your keys, not your coins\" has always been true.  I'd previously rolled my eyes at that expression, scoffing at the paranoid crypto maximalists who would spout it.  Not any more.  But what do you - in practice - do about it?"

In computer science, _binary_ (base 2), _octal_ (base 8) and _hexadecimal_ (base 16) are often used.  Hexadecimal extends the numerical digits with ABCDEF.  Base 64 is also often used to compress numbers using all letters and numbers (including lower-case and two punctuations) to extend the digit set.  However when those numbers need to be manually copied, there can be visual confusion between some of the letters.  Hence base 58, which excludes e.g. [\"0 (zero), O (capital o), I (capital i) and l (lower case L)\"](https://digitalbazaar.github.io/base58-spec/#:~:text=similar%20looking%20letters%20are%20omitted%20such%20as%200%20(zero)%2C%20O%20(capital%20o)%2C%20I%20(capital%20i)%20and%20l%20(lower%20case%20L).%20Doing%20so%20eliminates%20the%20possibility%20of%20a%20human%20being%20mistaking%20similar%20characters%20for%20the%20wrong%20character.)\n",
