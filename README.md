# Bitcoin Wallets

How to create a Bitcoin wallet.

Manipulating Bitcoin programatically is a remarkably straightforward process - as it should be!  That's the whole promise and genius of Bitcoin, and why it is revolutionary.

To understand this better, read and run [bitcoin-wallet.ipynb](/bitcoin-wallet.ipynb) after setting up your environment:

It was written in Python 3.12.2 (but should be fine in most Python 3 versions).

**To run the code**:

1. Install `git` 
2. Install `jupyter` or `jupyter-lab` - or use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
3. Download it with
```shell
git clone git@github.com:profitviews/bitcoin-wallet.git
```
4. `cd bitcoin-wallet`
5. Install dependencies with
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Launch `bitcoin-wallet.ipynb` as a Jupyter notebook using whichever means you chose above.
